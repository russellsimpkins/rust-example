If you don't have a test directory, make sure you run

  ./vendor/bin/codecept bootstrap

That command will set up the basics for you. Then you can go ahead and generate a phpunit test with:

  ./vendor/bin/codecept generate:phpunit unit <name of test>

So, if you wanted a new unit test, named test case you would run:

  ./vendor/bin/codecept generate:phpunit unit testCase

To get coverage reports

  ./vendor/bin/codecept run --coverage controller

To generate a new acceptance test:
  ./vendor/bin/codecept generate:cept controller BooksAp

To regen your guys run

  ./vendor/bin/codecept build
